# Comparative Wordlist Elicitation Tool (Android)

This repository contains the source code for an Android application designed to assist **trained linguists, fieldworkers, and community members** in the systematic **elicitation and documentation of minority languages** through the collection of comparative wordlists like the [Quickstart Wordlist of Melanesia](https://www.sil.org/resources/archives/100200) or the [Comparative African Wordlist](https://www.sil.org/resources/archives/7882).

The primary goal is to provide a tool simple enough for native speakers with limited technical and reading abilities to collect high-quality data.

The tool facilitates the collection of:

- **Phonetic Transcriptions:** Input fields for documenting words using IPA or other relevant orthographies.

- **Audio Recordings:** Functionality to capture high-quality audio recordings associated with each word.

- **Media Display:** Ability to display relevant pictures or media (when available in the wordlist data) to aid the elicitation process.

## Attribution

This documentation, including the project goals, feature set, and technical scope, was collaboratively authored by **Seth Johnston** via an extensive chat conversation and planning session with **Gemini**, a large language model from Google.

## ðŸš§ Project Status: Seeking Initial Contributors ðŸš€

**This project is currently in the conceptual and planning phase.** We are actively seeking **Android Developers** interested in linguistic fieldwork and open-source software to help build the initial application structure and core features. If you are looking for a high-impact project, please check the **Issues** tab to see initial feature discussions!

## Core Features and Technical Scope (MVP Focus)

The goal is to create a robust and reliable fieldwork companion. Initial development should focus on these key areas:

### 1. Data Management

- **XML Import:** Implement an efficient, fault-tolerant parser for the Dekereke XML format imported by the user.

- **Local Storage:** Utilize **SQLite/Room** for persistent storage of the imported wordlist, newly collected transcriptions, and metadata.

- **Session Tracking:** Allow users to resume fieldwork sessions and track which words have been elicited.

- **Target Applications:** The goal of the exported data is for use with professional linguistic tools like **Dekereke** (https://casali.canil.ca/Dekereke/) and **Fieldworks Language Explorer (FLEx)** (https://software.sil.org/fieldworks/).

- **Export:** Implement functionality to package and export all collected data into a single **ZIP archive**.
  
  - **Required XML File (MVP):** The initial release must export the collected data in **Dekereke XML** format (matching the input structure).
  
  - **Future XML File Goal:** Implement export to **LIFT XML** (Linguistic Interlinearized Format and Toolkit) in a subsequent release. (LIFT Documentation: https://downloads.languagetechnology.org/fieldworks/Documentation/Technical%20Notes%20on%20LIFT%20used%20in%20FLEx.pdf)

  The export must adhere to the following audio specifications for all formats:

- **Audio Folder:** A dedicated `audio` folder containing all elicited recordings.

- **Audio Format:** 16-bit WAV.

- **Audio Naming Convention:** Files must be named using the 4-digit, leading-zero reference number from the word's `Reference` field, followed by the text from the word's `Gloss` field, with spaces replaced by periods (e.g., `0001body.wav`).

- **XML Linking:** The corresponding audio filename (e.g., `0001body.wav`) must be included within the matching record in the exported XML files: in the `<SoundFile>` element/field for Dekereke XML, and as a voice writing system reference for LIFT XML (once implemented).

### 2. Elicitation Interface

- **Responsive UI & Accessibility:** Design an **extremely simple, visually driven, and intuitive interface**. The UI must rely minimally on text labels, using large icons and high-contrast color schemes suitable for all users, including those with lower reading or technical abilities. Optimized for tablet and mobile use in fieldwork environments (often low-light or outdoor settings).

- **Localization (i18n):** **Crucial Requirement:** All static in-app text (e.g., button labels, settings headers, instructions, consent text) must be fully localizable. The researcher must be able to configure and bundle the appropriate language of wider communication within the application package.

- **Transcription Input:** The input field must be compatible with **IPA** characters.
  
  - **Encoding:** Ensure compatibility with **UTF-16** for Dekereke XML and **UTF-8** for LIFT XML export.
  
  - **Fonts:** The app should either include or clearly instruct the user to import OFL-licensed fonts compatible with IPA, such as **Charis SIL** (https://software.sil.org/charis/) or **Doulos SIL** (https://software.sil.org/doulos/). Developers should verify and include the necessary SIL Open Font License (OFL) documentation.
  
  - **Keyboard Integration:** Recommend that users install **Keyman** (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tavultesoft.kmapro) as their system-wide Android keyboard for efficient IPA entry.

- **Media Integration:** Display associated images or media files referenced in the wordlist data, using large, clear display areas. **The XML parser and data model must support an optional `<Picture>` field/element, which links to researcher-supplied image files.**

### 3. Ethical Data Collection and Consent (MVP Requirement)

- **Goal:** Ensure clear, ethically sound, **informed consent** is obtained from the native speaker before any data collection begins. This is an absolute requirement for the MVP.

- **Researcher Configuration:** The application must support highly customizable consent prompts, which must be configurable by the researcher (ideally via the App Bundling Wizard, or initial in-app setup). Two primary configurable modes are required:
  
  - **Verbal/Audio Consent:** Play a pre-recorded audio file (in the native language) explaining the project's purpose and data usage. The user must provide assent by pressing an explicit  
    
    IAgree
    
    button, or by recording their verbal assent.
  
  - **Written Consent:** Display a clear, simple text explanation (in the native language) with explicit  Yes / No buttons.

- **Consent Record:** The application must create a persistent, timestamped **Consent Log** containing:
  
  - The date and time the consent was sought and the response was recorded.
  
  - The user's unique device/session ID.
  
  - The type of prompt used (Verbal/Text) and the final response (Assent/Decline).
  
  - If Verbal Consent is used, the recording of the assent must be saved.

- **Data Export:** This Consent Log (and any associated verbal recording) must be included as a **separate, clearly identifiable file** (e.g., `consent_log.json` or `consent_log.txt`) in the final ZIP export and be included in the Cloud Data Sync.

### 4. Audio Recording

- **High-Quality Capture:** Implement reliable, easy-to-access functionality for recording and stopping audio directly linked to the current word entry. **The recording button must be large, highly visible, and instantly recognizable (e.g., a simple, iconic microphone/dot).**

- **Storage:** Store audio files locally, organized by session or language identifier.

- **Playback:** Basic playback functionality to review the elicited audio instantly.

## Future Enhancements and Advanced Workflow (Phase 2+)

These features are intended for later development phases but are crucial for the long-term vision of empowering researchers and community members.

### A. Non-Technical App Bundling Wizard (New Desktop Project)

- **Goal:** Create a separate, open-source desktop application (e.g., for Windows/macOS/Linuxâ€”likely licensed under AGPL or GPL) similar in function to Scripture App Builder (https://software.sil.org/scriptureappbuilder/).

- **Functionality:** This wizard would allow a researcher (who does not know Kotlin or XML) to:
  
  1. Automatically include the base APK of this Android app (no manual selection required).
  
  2. Specify a custom wordlist (XML) and matching picture files.
  
  3. Configure optional settings (e.g., cloud upload folder credentials, **consent prompts**).
  
  4. Generate a **customized, pre-configured APK bundle** ready for side-loading onto a native speaker's device. This eliminates the need for the user to manually import files.

### B. Cloud Data Sync (Essential for Fieldwork)

- **Goal:** Provide secure, researcher-configurable background synchronization of collected data.

- **Functionality:**
  
  - Allow the researcher to configure credentials for a cloud service (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox, or a custom server) within the App Bundling Wizard.
  
  - The Android app should upload collected transcriptions and audio files either **incrementally** (as they are recorded) or in **bulk** when an internet connection is available.

### C. AI Image Generation Helper

- **Goal:** Offer the researcher an integrated tool to quickly generate visual aids for words that lack images.

- **Functionality:** Integrate the Google Gemini API to generate simple, descriptive **pencil sketch-style AI images** based on the word's gloss. The researcher would review, approve, and save these images to their media folder for inclusion in the App Bundle (Feature A). **Crucial:** This AI generation happens on the researcher's desktop/tool, not within the AGPL-licensed Android app, ensuring the core app remains clean and resource-light.

## Recommended Technology Stack

You can implement this app using either native Android (Kotlin) or Flutter (Dart). Choose the option that best fits contributor expertise and deployment needs. Both approaches must meet the same functional requirements (XML import/export, WAV audio handling, localization, accessibility, consent logging).

- Native Android (Kotlin)
  - Language: Kotlin (Recommended)
  - UI Framework: Jetpack Compose (preferred for modern, scalable UI) or traditional XML/Views.
  - Architecture: Clean Architecture (MVVM) is encouraged for maintainability.
  - Data Persistence: Android Room (for SQLite abstraction).
  - XML Parsing: Standard Android/Kotlin XML libraries (e.g., XmlPullParser, SAX, DOM).

- Flutter (Dart) â€“ Alternate Option
  - Language: Dart
  - UI Framework: Flutter
  - Architecture: Clean Architecture with BLoC, Riverpod, or Provider.
  - Data Persistence: sqflite or drift (SQLite abstraction).
  - XML Parsing: xml (Dart package on pub.dev).
  - Android Integration Notes: Ensure Android-specific permissions (microphone, storage), file handling, and 16â€‘bit WAV export conform to the requirements described above.
