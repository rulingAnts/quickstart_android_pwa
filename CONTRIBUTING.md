Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project is a browser-based PWA implemented with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. Flutter/Dart is no longer used.

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Focus on constructive feedback
- Help maintain a welcoming environment for all contributors

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js 18+**
2. **Git**
3. A modern browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox/Safari)

### Setup Development Environment

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Quickstart_Android.git
   cd Quickstart_Android
   ```

3. Run locally:
  ```bash
  npm install
  npm start
  # open http://127.0.0.1:5173
  ```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

### 2. Make Changes

- Follow the existing code structure
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Update tests for changed functionality

### 3. Validate Your Changes

- Ensure the app loads and the service worker updates cleanly
- Test import/export with sample data in `test_data/`
- Verify audio record/playback and the 16-bit WAV capability check

### 4. Commit Changes

Write clear commit messages:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add consent screen UI

- Implement verbal consent option
- Add written consent display
- Include consent recording capability"
```

Commit message format:
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding/updating tests
- `chore:` - Build/config changes

### 5. Push and Create PR

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```
Then open a Pull Request.

## Code Style Guidelines

### Code Style

- Keep it simple and dependency-free when possible
- Use meaningful variable/function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Prefer progressive enhancement and graceful errors

### File Organization

```
www/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ css/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ storage.js
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ xml-parser.js
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ audio-recorder.js
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ export.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ service-worker.js
```

### Widget Structure

```dart
class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyWidget({super.key, required this.data});

  final String data;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      // Widget tree
    );
  }
  
  // Helper methods below build()
  Widget _buildHelper() {
    return Text(data);
  }
}
```

### Testing Guidelines

Manual testing is usually sufficient:
- Import sample XML, verify entries sorted by numeric Reference
- Record a short audio, confirm playback and inclusion in export
- Export ZIP and inspect: UTF-16LE XML, audio files named like `0001body.wav`

## Documentation

### Code Comments

- Add doc comments for public APIs
- Explain "why" not "what" in inline comments
- Keep comments up-to-date

```dart
/// Imports a Dekereke XML wordlist file and stores entries in the database.
///
/// Returns the number of successfully imported entries.
/// Throws [Exception] if the file format is invalid.
Future<int> importDekerekeXml(String filePath) async {
  // Implementation
}
```
