### Notes

This is the initial Flutter implementation of the Comparative Wordlist Elicitation Tool. The codebase is licensed under AGPL-3.0. Wordlist data is licensed separately under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 and is not bundled with the app.

#### Known Limitations
- Audio uses device default sample rate (not configurable to 16-bit WAV yet)
- Currently supports Dekereke XML format only
- No built-in consent screen UI (structure exists, UI pending)
- Images referenced in XML are not yet displayed in UI
- iOS platform not yet configured

#### Migration from Native Android
This Flutter implementation provides an alternative to the Kotlin/Jetpack Compose approach outlined in the main README. Both implementations follow the same functional requirements.
